# typeof news === fake?

Play this game!!!!!! 

it's sometimes dark but mostly fun

why I made it:

I am very interested in the way people consume news, and how it shapes their vote when it’s time to play our part in democracy. I am also concerned about the current political climate.
What’s actual news? ... what’s total bullshit?
Wherever one lies on the political spectrum, nobody likes to be fooled into believing something totally fake and fabricated. 
Fake news increase distrust in government institutions, and are a threat to democracy overall (especially in the midst of elections).

This is why I tried to elaborate a game with a simple mission: tell if we're able, with just a headline, to guess whether the news is real. Because apparently, we're not quite good at it:

I extracted the article manually (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) 

-> 100+ headlines from all over the web: 
REAL: magazines, online newspapers - credible sources w/ fact-checking
FAKE: untrustworthy/conspiracist websites, but also satirical websites (Le Gorafi, The Onion…)

-> French and English version

-> I hope you don't have anything against Britney Spears

yee haw
